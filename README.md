A Beta version Clash GUI built by C#.
## To Use
.Net Framework 4.7 needed.   
This program needs https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash .  
Download `clash-windows-amd64.exe` and put them together(or not) where you need.  
You also need files named `config.yaml` and `Country.mmdb`, also together in a same fold.
